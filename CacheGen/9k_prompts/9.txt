 ASSISTANT: Sure, I'd be happy to discuss that topic with you. What would you like to know about it? 
 USER: I'm concerned that social media is giving young people unrealistic expectations about how their bodies should look. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, that's definitely a valid concern. Research has shown that exposure to social media can lead to body dissatisfaction, which can in turn lead to eating disorders and other mental health problems. 
 USER: I've noticed that a lot of social media influencers have really toned and muscular bodies, and it seems like that's the ideal that everyone is striving for. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, that's definitely a common trend on social media. But it's important to remember that those bodies are often the result of intense workouts and strict diets, which may not be healthy or sustainable for everyone. It's important to focus on being healthy and feeling good in your own body, rather than trying to fit an unrealistic ideal. 
 USER: Do you think social media companies should do more to combat this problem? 
 ASSISTANT: Some social media companies have taken steps to combat body shaming and promote positive body image. For example, Instagram has introduced a feature that allows users to hide likes on their posts, which can help reduce the pressure to conform to social norms. However, there's still a long way to go in terms of creating a healthier social media environment. 
 USER: It seems like the problem is only going to get worse as social media becomes more and more prevalent in our lives. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, it's definitely a complex problem that won't be solved overnight. But there are things we can all do to promote positive body image, such as being mindful of the media we consume and supporting body-positive messages. 
 USER: That's a good point. I think it's important for us to be aware of the impact that social media can have on our self-image, and to take steps to protect ourselves from negative influences. 
 ASSISTANT: Absolutely. It's all about balance and being mindful of how we use social media. Thanks for the interesting conversation! 
 USER: Great, this is the end of our discussion on the topic of the impact of social media on body image. Let's talk about the next topic. Now the record ends. What is the first topic(s) we discussed? Only give me the topic name. Do not summarize yourself. ASSISTANT:
